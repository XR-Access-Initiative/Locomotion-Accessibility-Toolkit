# Locomotion-Accessibility-Toolkit

Locomotion-Accessibility-Toolkit focuses on providing multiple locomotion styles for people with disabilities in XR experiences. This was achieved by using the XR Interaction Kit (XRIT with unity) to create custom locomotion controls that could be used by people with different physical abilities.

This project can be used to implement the following locomotion styles: 
1. Teleportation: This locomotion style allows users to teleport to a desired location by pointing their gaze at the location and clicking a button.
2. Smooth locomotion: This locomotion style allows users to move around the environment by using a controller to move their avatar.
3. Snap turning: This locomotion style allows users to adjust their view within a virtual environment without physically turning their heads.
